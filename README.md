THE WEBSITE IS LIVE ON : https://abhineswari.github.io/Timeline/

The project is organized in a simple and intuitive way to make it easy to understand and maintain. The index.html file serves as the main page, displaying the interactive timeline. All styling is contained in styles.css, which handles layout, responsiveness, and visual design. The script.js file powers the interactivity, including dynamically loading events, handling modal pop-ups, and user interactions.Event data is stored separately in events.json, allowing for easy updates or additions of new historical milestones without modifying the core code. Historical images for each event are stored in a dedicated images folder, keeping media assets organized and accessible. This structure ensures a clean separation of content, styling, and functionality, making the application scalable and easy to maintain.
