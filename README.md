# Timeline App - Stage 1

## Project Title:
**Timeline App (Static Skeleton)**

## Description:
This is the **Stage-1 static structure** of a Timeline Web Application being built as part of the *DataArt* assignment. The app is intended to visually represent a timeline of events using semantic HTML and a modular structure.

## What's included:

- `index.html` with:
  - `<header>` containing logo/title and a theme toggle button.
  - `<nav>` as a placeholder for future filter buttons.
  - `<main>` containing a `<section id="timeline">` where event markers will go.
  - Semantic tags like `<article>`, `<figure>` for structuring future content.
  - An empty `<div id="modal">` for future pop-up information.

## Current Limitations:
- No CSS or JavaScript used at this stage as per assignment rules.
- Purely structural HTML with placeholder sections for future dynamic functionality.

## Notes:
- This static skeleton is the foundation for further development in later stages, where styling, interactivity, and data-binding will be implemented.
- Developed as a student assignment under the **DataArt** project module.
